## How to Play

1.  Head to the link Above ðŸ‘†
2.  The game is ready to play directly in your browser. The game starts with "Player One's Turn". Player One uses the 'X' marker, and Player Two uses the 'O' marker.
3.  Click on any empty cell on the game board to place your marker.
4.  Turns will automatically alternate after each move.
5.  The game will detect if a player wins (by getting three markers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if it's a draw (when all cells are filled and no one has won).
6.  The score of the winning player will be increased automatically.
7.  To reset the game board without resetting the scores, click on the board after a game has ended.
8.  To adjust player names or completely reset the game, including scores, use the settings icon (cog icon) located in the bottom right corner of the game interface.
